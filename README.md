This repository is used to document my learning journey as I try to wrap my head around Git and GitHub, a I follow along Meta's Version Control course on Coursera.

## DEVLOG
This section shall be used for institial journaling, where I document my thoughts during my learning journey.

Honestly, I have stopped using Meta's Version Control course as reference to learn about Git and GitHub. The course material has been disappointing so far. I'll skip my gripes for later.

For now, what I have been able to do;
1. Install GitHub CLI in my Ubuntu WSL.
2. Authenticate to use GitHub CLI.
3. Initialise a new git repository and then use `gh repo create` within the repository's directory to put it in my GitHub.
4. git add README.md to start tracking it.
5. git commit -m to well...commit with a message.
6. git push to push the changes upstream to my GitHub.

It is all pretty much a blur right now, but hopefully as I continue I can make better sense of it. But being able to push changes to GitHub feels great. It's almost like uploading a post on Instagram. If that makes any sense.

Okay, I take it back. After the first inital commit. I added the previous entry. I then tried `git commit` and then `git push`. Thinking that I can then later see the changes updated on the repo's GitHub page. But unfortunately, it didn't work.

When I try `git log`, a command to see past commits, I don't see my previous commit attempt. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong.
